Good Day! How are you *today*?
I hope you're okay!
Don't ask the wrong question
it will lead to the wrong definition.
Good luck with pronounciation
you're going to need concentration
May I ask Ms/Mr
Are you oblivious and am I sinister?
You need to go already?
You should hear the clock's melody
You don't have *time*?
Then how do you exist without having a dime?
